# Tactile - VR data visualization
## Development
To start the WebPack development server,
```
npm run start
```
This will hotload any changes to JavaScript files and refresh your browser window. By default the server is hosted at `localhost:9000`.

**NOTE**: The site must use `https` in order for the VR browser to allow entering VR mode.
